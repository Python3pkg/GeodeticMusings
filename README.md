#Geodetic musings

This is a litle benchmark of three Python libraries to compute geodesic distances:
- Pyproj.
- Pygc.
- GeographicLib.


##Benchmark in a IPython Notebook
You can see benchmark in a IPython Notebook with all computations and outputs in this links:

- Pyproj (with Proj4 C Library v.4.9.1) + Pygc + GeographicLib:

- Pyproj (with Proj4 C Library v4.8.0) + Pygc + GeographicLib:

##Script
You can also launch the benchmark from shell:

```
$ python geodesicdist.py
```

You can test different Proj4 versions here:
