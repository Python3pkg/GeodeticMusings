#Geodetic musings

This is a litle benchmark of three Python libraries to compute geodesic distances:
- Pyproj.
- Pygc.
- GeographicLib.


##Benchmark in a IPython Notebook
You can see benchmark in a IPython Notebook with all computations and outputs in this links:

- Pyproj (with Proj4 C Library v.4.9.1).
- Pygc.
- GeographicLib.

- Pyproj (with Proj4 C Library v4.8.0).
- Pygc.
- GeographicLib.

##Script
You can also launch the benchmark from shell:

```
$ python geodesicdist.py
```
